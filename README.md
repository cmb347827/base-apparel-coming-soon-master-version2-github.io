## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Solved my issue with arranging the elements in correct order in mobile / desktop view with just a single form element.

- While working on the arrangement issue I noticed some other issues:

- I needed to change the `placeholder="Email Address"` placeholder text font color and how to change `placeholder="Email Address"` font color

- The regular expression did not work correctly in case someone entered: myemail@justemail.commmm

- I fixed that issue with a new regular expression.


### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascrip (plus some JQuery), Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now. In time I will go re-learn React ect.

### Useful resources

- [How to change placeholder font color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::placeholder) - How to change the `placeholder="Email Address"` font color
